How do I approach designing software?
- I take an iterative approach to software design, creating different code blocks that will be later connected. I also believe improvements can be made continuously, where I found myself restarting some models from scratch to improve design. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- Before this class, I had little to no 3D scene creation experience. Thanks to this project I have been able to craft skills in creating detailed objects with many smaller shapes.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
- Project work was done gradually, focusing on individual stages intensely, then finally placing it all together. Once I had each item shaped and in proper place, I began applying colors, textures, and lights to the scene as necessary. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
- Most projects I encounter will have different aspects that I can break down and apply individualized attention to. Maintaining extreme focus on one section at a time will be an essential tactic to use in future work. 
How do I approach developing programs?
- When developing a program for a client, I find it necessary to get all necessary information from the client first. Then, as I begin to create features, I will have them review, critique, and suggest features. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- After each submission, I would take in criticism from the professor and apply it to my design. While this may not be a new strategy, I found it essential for program design as I have not had previous experience in OpenGL. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
- Each part of my program was created in stages, with higher level features being added as the weeks went on. This iterative process maintained good development pace, while providing individualized care to each aspect of my project. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
- At the beginning of the course, I found myself typing each object and item out. As more and more objects started to populate the scene, I found it extremely efficient to copy base code for shapes, to paste as necessary for brand new objects. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- It is my goal to become a professional Video Game Designer, so computer science goes hand-in-hand with my dreams. Developing understanding for how computers and software work will help in future developments in my field. This base knowledge will also help me learn more complicated concepts, as programs all derive from the same beginnings. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- Computational graphics and visualizations begin with developments in the 3rd dimension, allowing the creation of more complex programs and software. With this information, I will be able to better understand future classes. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
- As mentioned above, development in the 3rd dimension will be essential for future endeavors. However, as my professional pathway may lead to game development, graphics and visualization is necessary for making a game.
